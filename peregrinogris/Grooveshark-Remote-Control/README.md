# Grooveshark Remote Control
A simple Firefox extension to remote control the new Grooveshark API from any
webpage you're browsing.

## Requirements

This extension is coded with the new [AddonSDK](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/) for Firefox, so if you want to
fork this and contribute some code, first you need to get the AddonSDK. To do
that, just follow the steps in the [AddonSDK Repo](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/) page.
