# Oberon 07 compiler

Written in JavaScript and transaltes Oberon to JavaScript code so it can be run in web browser.

## Quick start
You can try the compiler online [here](http://oberspace.dyndns.org/oberonjs.html).

To build it locally run build.cmd (Python 2.x or 3.x is required). It will make _out/os.js and _out/oberonjs.html. Open oberonjs.html in the browser and try the compiler!
