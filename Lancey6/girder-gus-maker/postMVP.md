This file is for keep track of features we want to implement after we have optained a minimum viable product.

# Features
	* Published vs. Unpublished levels. A user who is still creating a level probably would not want people playing it while it is still in production
	* Anyone can edit any level, but the edited level is now saved under a new name
	* Users can create playlists of levels
	* Creators can create campaigns: series of levels which must be completed in order
	* Store info on playthroughs
		* Determine level difficulty based on attempts at a level vs. completions
		* Track who finishes fastest and with the fewest girders
		* Play against ghosts of previous plays
	* Login with google link is visually nice, not intuitively a button / link / etc.
	* Social sharing
	* Data viz for each level / user
